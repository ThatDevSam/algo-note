## Complexity Analysis
* Complexity Analysis is how we measure the effeciency of a program.
* Ultimatly it give us an objective way of measuring the effeciency of a solution to a problem.
* time complexity - measure of how much time a solution takes to run.
* space complexity - measure of how much space a solution takes up in computer memory.
